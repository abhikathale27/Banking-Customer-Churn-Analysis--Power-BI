# Banking-Customer-Churn-Analysis--Power-BI

# Project Description:
Customer churn is a critical issue in the banking sector, directly impacting profitability and customer retention strategies. This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns using Power BI, leveraging historical customer data to identify key factors contributing to attrition. The analysis will help the bank develop data-driven strategies to enhance customer retention and improve overall customer satisfaction.

# Objectives:
Identify key reasons for customer churn using data-driven insights.
Build interactive Power BI dashboards for visualizing churn trends and patterns.
Perform data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) from SQL Server or Excel into Power BI.
Use DAX calculations and measures to derive meaningful insights.
Segment customers based on demographics, transaction behavior, and engagement.
Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn.
# Data Sources:
Customer demographics (age, gender, income, etc.)
Account details (account type, tenure, balance, etc.)
Transaction history (frequency, amount, type)
Customer support interactions
Feedback and complaints
Churn status (existing or lost customers)
Tools & Technologies:
Power BI (Data visualization & reporting)
SQL Server / Excel (Data source)
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) (For calculations)
Power Query (M Language) (For data transformation)
Python / R (Optional) (For advanced analytics & ML models)
# Key Features in the Power BI Dashboard:
